# Experimental Notebooks

This directory contains exploratory and experimental notebooks for learning and prototyping.

## Purpose

Unlike complete case studies, these notebooks are for:
- Quick experiments and prototyping
- Learning new techniques
- Testing model capabilities
- Exploring new APIs and libraries
- Debugging and troubleshooting

## Organization

Name your notebooks descriptively:
- `01_exploring_clip_model.ipynb`
- `02_testing_whisper_transcription.ipynb`
- `03_stable_diffusion_experiments.ipynb`

## Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Notebooks here don't need full documentation
2. **Date your work**: Include creation date in filename or first cell
3. **Note the purpose**: Brief comment at the top explaining the goal
4. **Graduate to case studies**: When an experiment matures, move it to `case-studies/`

## Example Structure

```python
# Notebook: Exploring Vision Transformers
# Date: 2025-12-14
# Goal: Test ViT performance on custom images

# Quick setup
import torch
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification

# Experiments below...
```
